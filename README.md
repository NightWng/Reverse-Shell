In network engineering, reverse shell tools are valuable for remote administration, penetration testing, incident response, and automating routine tasks. They enable secure, remote access to devices, aiding in troubleshooting and configuration, while also playing a crucial role in security assessments and training simulations.

Using a combination of socket programming in Python and an external server I was able to build a prototype of a reverse shell which I later improved upon by adding multi-client support.

Currently my server is not live anymore as my free trial has expired, however at the time was setup on Digital Ocean: https://try.digitalocean.com/cloud/?utm_campaign=amer_brand_kw_en_cpc&utm_adgroup=digitl_ocean_Misspellings&_keyword=digital-ocean&_device=c&_adposition=&utm_content=conversion&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzva1BhD3ARIsADQuPnWs9Gn1m1yg1-9mMZIuGKl1TNflMfF0Ddk-HnwZJtCryS1KxFvr8LsaAsNUEALw_wcB.
